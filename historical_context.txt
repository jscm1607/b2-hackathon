Biosphere 2: Failed Experiments - Narratives

1. Atmospheric Seal Control Experiment: Air and CO2 Leakage
-----------------------------------------------------------
Narrative:
One of the major problems faced by the Biosphere 2 experiment from the beginning was air leakage, resulting in an imbalance in oxygen and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. The designers of Biosphere 2 intended to create a completely sealed environment to simulate the conditions of a self-sustaining space habitat, but they did not anticipate that the structure made of glass and sealing materials would not be completely airtight.

Over time, oxygen levels began to decrease and CO2 levels started to rise. This imbalance was caused by several factors, including the air leaks in the building’s walls. The amount of accumulated CO2 reached dangerous levels, especially during the early stages of the experiment. Plants within the ecosystem absorbed CO2 and released oxygen, but it wasn’t enough to keep the levels within safe limits.

The strategy to solve this problem was to inject oxygen into the air inside Biosphere 2, but this was only a temporary measure. To counteract the elevated CO2 levels, the scientists installed a chemical precipitator to absorb excess carbon dioxide. Additionally, they began increasing the number of fast-growing plants, as plants capture CO2 and convert it into oxygen through photosynthesis. However, the solution was not fully effective, and perfect control over the gases remained a constant challenge...

This experiment highlighted a critical lesson: structural design and sealing capability are key elements for the success of a closed ecosystem, especially when aiming to simulate long-term sustainable conditions. Poor management of gases was one of the most significant failures in Biosphere 2 and emphasized the importance of controlling the atmosphere in a closed environment.

2. Food Production Experiment: Light Deficiency and Pests
-----------------------------------------------------------
Narrative:
In the food production experiment, scientists attempted to grow enough crops to feed the biospherians during their stay in the closed system. This experiment was fundamental to demonstrate the viability of sustainable agriculture in an isolated environment, but it faced several challenges. Light distribution turned out to be a critical factor affecting the success of crop production.

Biosphere 2 was designed to provide a controlled environment, but the necessary light intake for crops to grow efficiently was underestimated. The building’s walls, although transparent, did not allow enough natural sunlight to penetrate, and the artificial lighting systems were insufficient to replicate the amount of sunlight that crops required. This caused the plants to grow more slowly and weakly, reducing food production and affecting the health of the crops.

Moreover, the closed conditions created a perfect breeding ground for pests, which proliferated due to the lack of natural pest control. The biospherians had to deal with insects that damaged the crops, exacerbating the food shortage. Although biological control strategies were implemented, such as using predatory insects, they were not enough to prevent the spread of pests. The lack of an efficient pest control system led to the partial failure of the agricultural system.

Despite these obstacles, the experiment provided important lessons about agriculture in closed environments, emphasizing that light, pest control, and efficient nutrient management are key factors for successful food production in closed systems. The light deficiency and pests were the main causes of failure in this experiment.

3. Coral Reef Experiment: Nutrient Imbalance and Low Water Circulation
-----------------------------------------------------------
Narrative:
The coral reef experiment in Biosphere 2 faced significant problems related to the health of the marine ecosystem. The goal of this experiment was to recreate a self-sustaining marine ecosystem, with a coral reef that could survive and thrive within the closed system. However, the problems with nutrients and water circulation led to the failure of this experiment.

Biosphere 2 had a system designed to mimic the ocean and coral reef, but they did not anticipate the negative effects of nutrient deficiencies. In a closed ecosystem, nutrients are not naturally replenished as they are in open oceans, which led to the levels of essential nutrients for coral health, such as calcium, being inadequate. The water circulation was also insufficient to maintain a healthy environment for the corals and fish. The lack of oxygen and high acidity contributed to the coral reef...

Although some attempts were made to adjust the water flow and add calcium supplements to balance the pH, the marine system in Biosphere 2 never fully stabilized. The health of the aquatic ecosystem deteriorated rapidly, and the experiment failed to replicate a self-sustaining coral reef.

This failure showed that marine ecosystems in closed systems require extremely careful management of nutrients and water circulation, as well as species integration in a way that maintains the necessary balance for marine life. This experiment provided valuable lessons on the importance of nutrient cycles in closed ecosystems.

4. Health and Wellbeing Experiment: Psychological Stress and Isolation
-----------------------------------------------------------
Narrative:
A crucial aspect of Biosphere 2 was the total isolation of the biospherians, who were required to live inside the closed system for two years, without contact with the outside world. While the goal was to simulate the conditions of a long-term space mission, the psychological pressures turned out to be an unforeseen challenge.

The psychological stress resulting from isolation, lack of social contact with the outside world, and the enclosed nature of the environment severely affected the mental health of the participants. The team began experiencing interpersonal difficulties and stress from the constant work required to maintain the ecosystem’s balance, which increased tensions within the group.

The biospherians also faced difficulties with their sleep routines due to the lack of natural light, resulting in circadian rhythm problems and chronic fatigue. This psychological stress became one of the most significant factors contributing to the deterioration of cooperation within the team.

Despite efforts to manage this stress through meetings and psychological support, the prolonged stress affected the performance of the team and compromised the effectiveness of the experiment. This experience highlighted the importance of mental health in any isolated mission, especially in space missions.
